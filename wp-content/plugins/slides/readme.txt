Where `[slides]` and `[/slides]` are the beginning and ending of Slides slider respectively, keep on adding as many `[slidesslide linkurl="LinkURL" linktitle="LinkTitle" imgurl="FullPathOfImage" imgalt="ImgAlt"]` for as many slides you want.

`<div id="slides">
	<div class="slides_container">
		<a href="LinkURL" title="LinkTitle" target="_blank"><img src="FullPathOfImage" width="570" height="270" alt="ImgAlt"></a>
	</div>
	<a href="#" class="prev"><img src="PathOf-arrow-prev.png-image" width="24" height="43" alt="Arrow Prev"></a>
	<a href="#" class="next"><img src="PathOf-arrow-next.png-image" width="24" height="43" alt="Arrow Next"></a>
